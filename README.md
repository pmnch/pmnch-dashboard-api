# Harmony API

API for Harmony.

Harmony is a tool using AI and natural language processing, which allows you to compare items from questionnaires and
identify similar content.

The API is live at https://api.harmonydata.org and you can try the docs at https://api.harmonydata.org/docs

You can try Harmony at https://app.harmonydata.org and you can read our blog at https://harmonydata.org/blog/.

## Harmonising Mental Health Data

Do you need to compare questionnaire data across studies? Do you want to find the best match for a set of items? Are
there are different versions of the same questionnaire floating around and you want to make sure how compatible they
are? Are the questionnaires written in different languages that you would like to compare?

Harmony is a data harmonisation project that uses Natural Language Processing to help researchers make better use of
existing data from different studies by supporting them with the harmonisation of various measures and items used in
different studies. Harmony is a collaboration project between the University of Ulster, University College London, the
Universidade Federal de Santa Maria in Brazil, and Fast Data Science Ltd.

Parse Instruments

Parse PDFs or Excels or text files into Instruments, and identifies the language.

If the file is binary (Excel or PDF), you must supply each file with the content in MIME format and
the bytes in base64 encoding, like the example RawFile in the schema.

If the file is plain text, supply the file content as a standard string.
